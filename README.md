# ML from first principles

This repository is my effort to understand machine learning more deeply, by implementing
the concepts I've studied in graduate courses or on my own. This repo uses
[Torch](http://torch.ch).

Here's a short list of the things implemented or on the docket:

  - [x] Vanilla SGD
  - [x] Scaling
  - [ ] Neural nets (basic feedforward, RNN)
  - [ ] Adam
  - [ ] Adagrad
